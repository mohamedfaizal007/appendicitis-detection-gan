Automated Appendicitis Detection using GAN-enhanced CT Scans

This project focuses on the automated detection of appendicitis from contrast-enhanced CT scans using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Medical imaging often suffers from noise, low contrast, or artifacts, which can make accurate diagnosis challenging. In this work, GANs are employed to enhance the quality of CT images, improving the clarity of anatomical structures and highlighting features relevant to appendicitis. The enhanced CT scans are then analyzed using advanced machine learning and deep learning models to automatically classify the presence or absence of inflammation in the appendix. This approach aims to assist radiologists in faster and more reliable diagnosis, reduce human error, and provide a foundation for computer-aided diagnosis systems in medical imaging. The project demonstrates the integration of image enhancement, deep learning, and medical AI, highlighting the potential of GANs to improve clinical workflows and patient outcomes.
